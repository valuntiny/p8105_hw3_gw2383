```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(p8105.datasets)
```

## Problem 1

### data cleaning

```{r}
brfss_df = 
  p8105.datasets::brfss_smart2010 %>% 
  janitor::clean_names() %>% # cleaning
  rename(location_abbr = locationabbr, location_desc = locationdesc) %>% # format the variable name
  filter(topic == "Overall Health") %>% # focus on the “Overall Health” topic 
  filter(response %in% c("Poor", "Fair", "Good", "Very good", "Excellent")) # choose response
```

### some questions

* In 2002, `r names(which(brfss_df %>% distinct(location_abbr, location_desc) %>% select(location_abbr) %>% table() == 7))` states were observed at 7 locations

* spaghetti plot

```{r}

```
